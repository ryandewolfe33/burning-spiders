4:
- Proved by considering burning as a covering problem

5:
- Proof idea is that to match balls to components and an induction on the number of vertices.

6:
- The value in condition (2) is exactly what is required to make sure the alpha of the remainder is one less.
- Proof by induction on step (2) until its in G

12:
- Bullet 2, fewer vertices means Path-Forest Lemma Applies.

16:
- Bullet 3, this is the alpha-1 arms of length alpah + 1 case,
  we are applying the path-forest lemma to G burn starting at a vertex adjacent to the head.
